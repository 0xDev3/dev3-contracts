# Dev3 Contract Decorators

Dev3 uses a system of `manifest.json` files to "decorate" smart contracts. This gives apps, wallets and other blockchain infrastructure contextual
cues on how to interact with any given smart contract.

The Dev3 system currently has integrations with OpenZeppelin and custom partnerships with RMRK & Knn3

## Want to integrate with Dev3 decorators?
