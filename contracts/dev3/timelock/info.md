# TimeLock Manager

This smart contract can be used for others to lock their tokens on a specific period of time.
Anyone can choose to lock any amount of an abritrary ERC20 token and while locked, tokens cannot be withdrawn.

Once the lock-up period expires, users can access their tokens again.

This implementation can support various business models where vendors require their customers to lock a specific amount of
their token in order to get a discount on products or services and so on.
