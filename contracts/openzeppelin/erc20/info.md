# ERC20

An ERC20 token contract keeps track of fungible tokens: any one token is exactly equal to any other token; no tokens have special rights or behavior associated with them. This makes ERC20 tokens useful for things like a medium of exchange currency, voting rights, staking, and more.

OpenZeppelin Contracts provides many ERC20-related contracts. On the [API reference](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/token/erc20) youâ€™ll find detailed information on their properties and usage.
